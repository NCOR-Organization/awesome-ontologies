# üìö Awesome Ontologies
A curated list of ontologies for semantic interoperability, AI systems, knowledge graphs, the semantic web, and digital twins.

This list is populated by volunteers. A scoreboard is provided below displaying user contributions to the list, where 1 ontology = 1 point.

## How to contribute?   
**All contributions must include updates to the main README.md file.** along with a dump of the ontology in the `/dump` folder. Your ontology should be added to the appropriate section (Upper-Level, Mid-Level, Domain Ontologies, etc.) following the existing format:

```markdown
- [Ontology Name](link-to-source) - Brief description of the ontology.
```
